# Simple CRUD CMS
This is a simple Node.js, Express, and SQLite app built as part of a [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) project.

In the project, we worked through the basic CRUD features (writing, viewing, editing, and deleting posts). As extra credit,  I added the user authentication features.

To set up this simple CMS on your own computer, download the source, install node_modules, and start the server.
```
git clone https://github.com/IAmJamesHall/simpleCMS.git
npm install
npm start
```

The CMS should be running on `localhost:3000`.

Login credentials are:
```
username: user
password: pass
```
